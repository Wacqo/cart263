The myth of Sisyphus


Need to figure out something that involves this prompt

Want to connect it somehow to the idea of rolling the bowler up the hill. Maybe by your voice? Since it is something that is interesting to me. Maybe that you need to say a word “x” amount of times in order to move the ball? Also the fact that there  might be a time limit to the time you have to say all the words to get the boulder to the top of the pile? The goal of the piece is to see how many times you can get the boulder to the top of the mountain, each time you do it gets harder and the key word might change, and you will also have less time to get the boulder to the top of the hill. You will have 2 lives, because of the myth of how he cheated death twice. There is a way to beat the simulation because of how it is never ending, it only becomes harder and harder so at some point you might just need to lose. Each time you lose a life you're timer gets reset.

How a generative art piece that is abstract that continually moves and grows. It might move in an upwards fashion as if someone is pushing a boulder up the  mountain. So the piece  could just keep repeating the same pattern and at the end  you are just left with a bunch of boulders on the screen. It moves around in an almost hassy way. I would say that I would use perlin noise loops to get the type of circle that I would want.

Although I prefer the first idea or a variation of that idea, something related to a game/art piece. The “boulder” in the game could still be the perlin noise loop. But you could make it move by your voice. I also love the Idea of how the game doesn't technically have an ending and you can play until you lose. Like an “hell” loop. It is an idea that really intrigues me.

The programs I would use for this would consist of javascript and I would also use annyang in order for the program to recognize your voice and allow you to interact with the program. I would also try to incorporate the add on responsive voice to allow for your program to respond to you and allow it to interact back with you.

	The vision I have with this project is I am taking the myth of Sisyphus and trying to make it to an interactive experience. Where you as a person need to take the place of Sisyphus, obviously we can't make people do manual labour through a computer so instead we will make them use their voice. It gives the player the feeling and the illusion that they are taking his place because they are constantly repeating a word in repetition in order to move the rocks or in our case loops up in a diagonal motion. Also as I mentioned before I really love the Idea of making this game or simulation not have a “good” ending in the fact that you can only loose.
